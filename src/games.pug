            p #[b Whiteout] was created specifically to fill a niche in the 4-panel tech community. I was tasked with finding and charting a song that slowed down in the second half, while still retaining melodic and rhythmic motifs from the faster section. The chart was adopted immediately by the curation team for Rumble in the Prairie and has been met with critical acclaim.
